## Overview

Week 3 provided an introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms in Java. We implemented various lists, explored key Java collections, studied searching and sorting algorithms, and learned how to analyze runtime performance using Big-O notation.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Data Structures

- What is a Data Structure?  
- Key Features of Data Structures in Java  
- Types of Data Structures in Java  
- Singly Linked List  
- Doubly Linked List  
- Circular Linked List  

### Day 2: Stack, Queue, and HashMap

- Stack (LIFO)  
- Queue (FIFO)  
- HashMap and Hashing Function  

### Day 3: Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  

### Day 4: Searching and Java Utilities

- `StringBuilder`  
- `StringBuffer`  
- `FileReader`  
- `InputStreamReader`  
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

### Day 5: Runtime Analysis and Big-O Notation

1. What is Runtime Analysis?  
2. Understanding Big-O Notation  
3. Time Complexity Analysis  
4. Space Complexity Analysis  
5. Best, Worst, and Average Case Complexities  
6. Practical Guidelines for Optimizing Java Code  

## Prerequisites

- Strong understanding of Java basics and OOP (Weeks 1 & 2)  
- JDK and a Java IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA)  
- Familiarity with arrays and control flow  

## How to Use This Repository

The repository is organized by day. Each folder includes code examples, exercises, and notes for that day's topic. Run the code, trace its logic, and modify it to gain a deeper understanding of each data structure and algorithm.

## Next Steps

In Week 4, we’ll explore exception handling, multithreading, file operations, and more advanced Java topics to move closer to real-world application development.
